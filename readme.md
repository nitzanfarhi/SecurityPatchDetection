# Security Patch Detection Repository

## Creating the dataset
```console
python data_collection\create_dataset.py --all -o data_collection\data
```

Notice that this dataset doesn't include the commits' generated data as it is very big. This can be generated by running only :
```console
 python data_collection\create_dataset.py  --commits -data_collection\data
```
## Running the training
```console
python train.py  -a before --model conv1d -k 10 --metadata -c
```
